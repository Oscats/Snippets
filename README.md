# Snippets
Welcome.  This repository exists to collect some of the random bits of code, functions, or whole libraries that we use to solve specific challenges while programming for our FRC Games.  <p>
  
  If it is late at night, and you think, "This would be an amazing program if only I could do..."<p>
  
  Perhaps this is the place to find the answer.  If it is not, please consider adding it.  <p>
  
  Good luck in all of your coding ventrues.<p>
